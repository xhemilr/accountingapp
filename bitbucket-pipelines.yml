#  Template .NET Core build

#  This template allows you to validate your .NET Core package.
#  The workflow allows running tests and code linting on the default branch.

# To run your pipeline on a Windows machine, create a self-hosted Windows runner.
# For instructions on setting up a Windows runner, see https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-runners-for-windows/
